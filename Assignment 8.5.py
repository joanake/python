# It is currently 2.87 days past the due date (2015-07-28) so your late penalty is 60 percent.

## 8.5 Open the file mbox-short.txt and read it line by line. When you find a line that starts with 'From ' like the following line:
## From stephen.marquard@uct.ac.za Sat Jan  5 09:14:16 2008
## You will parse the From line using split() and print out the second word in the line (i.e. the entire address of the person who sent the message). 
## Then print out a count at the end.Hint: make sure not to include the lines that start with 'From:'.
## You can download the sample data at http://www.pythonlearn.com/code/mbox-short.txt

fname = raw_input("Enter file name: ")
if len(fname) < 1 : fname = "mbox-short.txt"

fh = open(fname)
count = 0
for line in fh:
    words = line.split()                         #parse From line using split()
    if len(words) > 2 and words[0] == 'From':    #check for email addresses
        print words[1]                           #print out second word in the line
        count += 1                               #increase count
    else:
        continue

print "There were", count, "lines in the file with From as the first word"
#print out count at the end
